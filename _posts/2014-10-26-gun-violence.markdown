## Motivation

On Friday, October 24, 2014, two students were shot and killed and four were
wounded at Marysville high school in Washington. This comes hot on the heels of the 
tragic June 5, 2014 shooting at Seattle Pacific University in which another
student was killed and two more were injured.

Despite the obvious horror of these events, their proximity in both time and
space lend them the unique power to galvanize voters in the Seattle region
behind stricter gun control laws. Indeed, these kinds of events, like Columbine 
and Sandy Hook before them, might be the only chance our country has in the
political battle against those whose financial interests are so closely tied 
to the loosely regulated manufacture and sale of guns, and those whose sentiments of
personal freedom are linked with owning them.

It is abysmal, though perhaps unavoidable, that humans by their nature require
such grisly evidence of their errors before correcting them. Yet, if 
this is the case, we may be on the path to a brighter future in the long run.

I whipped up this sobering graph this morning using data I found on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States).

Alarmingly, while we seem to have had a fairly steady number of school shootings
between the mid-1800s and 2005, there has been an unmistakable exponential
increase since then.

This could be due to a large number of factors, though I doubt anyone would argue
that children's access to guns must be one of them.

If gun violence in schools across the nation continues to increase as this
graph would suggest, and especially if these types of shootings become increasingly 
geographically concentrated, we may see voters turn to face the issue of gun 
regulation head-on in the very near future out of sheer necessity.

## Analogous cultures

When discussing this drastic uptake in school shootings, it is tempting to blame the
troubling amount of violent material to be found in American culture.
From video games to blockbuster movies to the everyday news, violence and its 
glorification seem to be nearly omnipresent in the modern American consciousness.

However, I counter the assertion that this cultural aspect is the cause for our
high rate of child-related gun violence by inviting a comparison between the United
States and the United Kingdom, two countries that have relatively analogous
cultures. Both watch the same movies, listen to the same music, and play the same 
video games. One of American popular culture's most adored Brits, James Bond, 
is also one of its most lethal killers and Eminem, an American rapper who often 
references violent acts in his songs, has released more chart-topping albums 
in a row in the U.K. than anyone else except The Beatles.

There is one key difference, however, between the two cultures. Guns are tightly
controlled by law in the United Kingdom. As a direct result of the increased
level of regulation surrounding gun ownership in the U.K., its citizens owned
just 6.7 firearms (both legal and illegal) per 100 people in 2011, according to
[GunPolicy.org](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/united-kingdom). Compare
that to the [101.05 firearms owned per 100 people in the United States](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/united-states).

I argue that the significant discrepancy in gun control policy between the two
cultures is the primary reason for the immense gap in the total number of gun 
deaths recorded in each country. Despite similar pop culture fixations with violence,
the [United Kingdom had 146 gun deaths in 2011, while the United States had 32,163](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compare/192/total_number_of_gun_deaths/194). 
Normalized to account for the disparity in total population between the countries,
this comes out to 2.3 gun deaths per 1 million people in the U.K., and 103.7 gun
deaths per 1 million people in the U.S.

## What can be done

To me, the answer seems simple and clear. In our country we have made the purchase 
and sale of an extremely dangerous device, one whose sole purpose is to eviscerate 
and destroy whatever it is trained upon, whether that be an inanimate target, a wild 
animal, or a high school student, *very*, *very* easy. If it was less easy to
buy guns, I think we would see the number of people who end up owning them go down,
and by correlation, the number of poeple who shoot people with them go down as well.
