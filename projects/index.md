I'm almost always hacking on something in my spare time. Here is a collection of some of my favorite side projects.

- <h4>[alumnus.io](http://www.alumnus.io/) - \[[source](https://github.com/ianzapolsky/alumnus-django)\] </h4>
  - A Django web application I designed and implemented for the coach of the Columbia men's lightweight rowing team. Alumnus makes managing a large list of emails a breeze.
- <h4>[@art\_err\_day](https://twitter.com/art_err_day) - \[[source](https://github.com/ianzapolsky/art_err_day)\]</h4>
  - A twitter bot that I built. It tweets out a piece of art from one of my favorite artists every 12 hours.
- <h4>[culpa-scraper](https://github.com/ianzapolsky/culpa-scraper)</h4>
  - An API I wrote in Node.js that scrapes the Columbia University course directory and returns a list of upcoming classes taught by the most highly rated professors in each department, according to [CULPA.info](http://culpa.info/). Currently in use in production on [CULPA.info](http://culpa.info/) as well as a [demo page](http://bestprofs.info/) I set up for it. 
- <h4>[echothe.audio](http://echothe.audio/) - \[[source](https://github.com/ianzapolsky/echo-site)\]</h4>
  - A splash page I built for a friend's app.
- <h4>[deltasigcu.org](http://deltasigcu.org/) - \[[source](https://github.com/ianzapolsky/dsig-redesign)\]</h4>
  - An info page I built for my fraternity.
- <h4>[project euler](https://github.com/ianzapolsky/project-euler)</h4>
  - My progress through the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives). I often use these short exercises as an excuse to experiment with new programming languages.
