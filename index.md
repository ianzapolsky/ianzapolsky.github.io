Hi, my name is Ian Zapolsky. I currently work as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.appnexus.com/">AppNexus</a> in New York City. Before that I studied Computer Science and Jazz at Columbia University. In my free time, I love playing basketball and ultimate frisbee, making music, and building stuff on the web. 

My favorite hobby is jazz piano. You can check out some of my recent musical projects on my [bandcamp page](https://ianzapolsky.bandcamp.com/) or via the embedded player below.
